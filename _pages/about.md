Welcome to the second SG Programming Languages Summit!
The summit is an informal meeting for those based in Singapore with interests in programming languages research, broadly construed.

## Logistics

TBA


## Call for Presentations

We solicit presentations on programming languages research and related topics including, but not limited to, verification, proof theory, program synthesis, etc...  We also welcome proposals to hold small-scale hands-on tutorials or similar events at the summit.

We hope that you will share your exciting PL-related research, use cases, or even new ideas seeking collaborators at the summit.
Students are particularly encouraged to present and solicit feedback on your research from the wider research community.

We hope to accommodate all proposed talks, potentially with parallel tracks. All talks will be held in-person and each talk will be allocated approximately 20-30 minute slots.
